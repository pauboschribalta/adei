# Principal characteristics of R and its programming:

- Open-source.

- Highly Active Community. Functions and packages are personal creations from users. 

- Oriented to objects. 

- Extremely comprehensive. 

- It does not need a compiler to run code. 

- Direction to machine learning. 

- Compatibility with other Data Processing Technologies (Example: Use a spark cluster to process large datasets using R)

- R markdown to generate reports in any desired format.

- Operations directly on vectors, not too much looping.

- Data from APIs (and many other formats) can be easily pulled down.

# Initial commands and basic descriptive statistics:

How to citate R?


```{r}
citation()
```

Load package and data:

```{r}
# install.packages("car")
library(car)
data(Davis)
attributes(Davis)
# Numeric Univariant Description
summary(Davis)
# Rows and columns of data.frame Davis
dim(Davis)
```

Graphical description:

```{r}
# Graphical Description of numeric data

# Histograms:
par(mfrow=c(2,2))
hist(Davis$weight)
hist(Davis$weight,10)
hist(Davis$weight,10,col="blue")
hist(Davis$weight,10,col=rainbow(10))

# Histogram with proportions:
par(mfrow=c(1,1))
hist(Davis$weight,freq=F)  # Proportions

# Dotplot:
par(mfrow=c(2,1))
stripchart(Davis$weight,method="stack")
stripchart(Davis$weight,method="stack",xlab="weight",pch=19,col=3,main="Dotplot Weight in Davis dataset")

# Boxplots (two ways):
par(mfrow=c(2,3))
boxplot(Davis$weight)
boxplot(Davis$weight,col="blue",horizontal = TRUE)
boxplot(Davis$weight,col="blue",horizontal = TRUE, pch=19,labels=Davis$weight)

Boxplot(Davis$weight)
Boxplot(Davis$weight,col="blue",main= "Weight in Davis dataset - row name Id")
Boxplot(Davis$weight,col="blue",main=" Boxplot Weight - Weight Label for Outliers",labels=Davis$weight)

#Barplots and pie charts:
par(mfrow=c(2,2))
barplot(table(Davis$sex))
barplot(table(Davis$sex),col=rainbow(2))
pie(table(Davis$sex))
pie(table(Davis$sex),col=rainbow(2))

```

Description of variable factors:

```{r}
table(Davis$sex)
margin.table(table(Davis$sex))
prop.table(table(Davis$sex))
```

Ask for information, arguments and outputs of a function:

```{r}
# ?boxplot
```

Other functions:


```{r}
# View(Davis)
head(Davis, n = 20) # n = 20 means  that the first 20 lines are printed in the R console

attach(Davis)
summary(weight)
detach(Davis)
# summary(weight) # Do not work

with(Davis,tapply(height,sex,summary))
summary(Davis$height)
with(Davis,Boxplot(height~sex,pch=19,col=rainbow(2),main="Height vs Sex"))
```


# Set directory and load libraries to work with used cars data:

```{r}
# setwd("C:/Users/lmontero/Dropbox/DOCENCIA/FIB-ADEI/PRACTICA/CarPrices/LABS")
# setwd("E:/Docencia_UPC/GEI-ADEI/Lab 0") #Set working directory
# install.packages(c("car", "FactoMineR", "knitr"))
# Access to packages and its functions:
library(car)
library(FactoMineR)
library(knitr)
```

# Load Data and Select Sample:
```{r}
# Lecture of DataFrames:
df <- read.csv("Airbnb_Open_Data.csv")

# Union by row:
# df <- rbind(df1,df2,df3,df4)
dim(df)  # Size of data.frame
str(df) # Object class and description
names(df) # List of variable names

### Use birthday of 1 member of the group as random seed:
set.seed(12345)
# Random selection of x registers:
sam<-as.vector(sort(sample(1:nrow(df),1000)))
head(df)  # Take a look to the first rows/instances (6 rows)
df<-df[sam,]  # Subset of rows _ It will be my sample
summary(df)

#Keep information in an .Rdata file:
save(list=c("df"),file="MyAirbnb-Raw.RData")

```

R markdown offers the possibility to structure the document in different header levels:

# Header 1

## Header 2

### Header 3

and simple text included into pargraphs. 

To enumerate:

- Enumeration 1

- Enumeration 2

- ...

It also allows the user to write in **bold** and in *italica*. 

In addition, equations in $\LaTeX$ can be added when you are writing such as $2 \cdot x = 6$ and appart from text:

$$2 \cdot x = 6$$
More elements which can be included are: 

- $\LaTeX$ tables

- Images

- Links

- Bibliography

- $\LaTeX$ matrices

- ...
